# CLIP Models

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for various experiments testing out-of-the-box and fine-tuned CLIP model. 

## Notebooks Overview

1. **CLIP_Expanded_Frutis_360.ipynb**: This notebook applies out of the box CLIP model on the expanded Fruits-360 dataset (includes Fruits-360 + other ingredient categories like flour, eggs, meat, etc.)
2. **CLIP_Fre0burg.ipynb**: This notebook includes fine-tuning CLIP model on the Freiburg Grocery Dataset.
3. **CLIP_Fruits360.ipynb**: This notebook icludes fine-tuning CLIP model on the Fruits360 dataset. 

## Results
Overall, from these preliminary experiments, we concluded that CLIP was not as successful compared to the Segmentation + Detection approach that we chose to focus on instead.
